Create a coach class with attributes and calculated properties for each training category
the calculated properties will not be calculated again unless the attributes have changed
also include coach name

create methods for each coach role that returns the rating (int from 1 to 10)
the coach roles are ATe ATa DTe DTa PTe Pta Leave the methods body empty for me to fill

create a method that  will generate a list with the coaches best Roles
it willl be a list of tuples (role, rating) 
if the best role has a rating of 7 out of 10 it will return all roles that have 5 or more rating

in the main create a coaching team by creating coaches
they will be appended to a list
keep in mind that gk fitness and set pieces are excluded

Now create a method that will go through each training role and add all potential coaches for each
this will be a tuple with the coach name and star rating for the given role
so each role will end up with a list of tuples
now it will go through all combinations and sum the stars for each
in the end the highest will be returned
if that is not possible it wil error out
