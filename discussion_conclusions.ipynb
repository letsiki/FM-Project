    "After Using the Spearman correlation it all seems to make a lot more sense. Few preliminary obsevations I can make are the following:\n",
    "(Based on 1 year run of top-5 England Divisions Database searching for Wingers(AM), IW/IF(AM) and FB across all DB players)\n",
    "- Decisions Concentration Composure and Anticipation are above 20 in all positions I have checked so far.\n",
    "- Consistency is top everywhere\n",
    "- Of the Ball is huge in all wide players (at least)\n",
    "- Crossing is most important for FB then for IW/IF and then in Wingers.\n",
    "- Passing is most important in Wingers then in FB and then in IW/IF\n",
    "- Surprisingly Teamwork does not even make the least for Wingers and IW/IF and is relatively low for FB\n",
    "- Another surprise is the fact that IW/IF have 0.20 on both Agg and Bra Which puts them among their top stats\n",
    "- For Wingers Bra is the same but they have a lower aggression at 0.13 maybe indicating that they are more prone to bookings\n",
    "due to their wider positioning\n",
    "- Finally for FB bravery is ok at 0.16 and aggression is also lower probably for the same reason as the Wingers\n",
    "- Also urprising is the physicals observations\n",
    "- For FB acceleration and jumping is unimportant pace-strength-nat are a little bit and stamina-agility-balance a little bit more\n",
    "- For Wingers by far the most important is stamina agility-balance-pace-acc-nat are decent and strength is ok again no jumping here\n",
    "- For IW/IF Stamina is again top although not as much as wingers, agility is close to it and acc pace balance is significantly lower.\n",
    "Jumping and strength does not even make the list\n",
    "- Work rate seems to be disappointing being .15 for FB .11 for IW/IW and insignificant for wingers\n",
    "- Flair is underwhelming also around .15 for all positions not breaking in the top 10 of any of the three positions\n",
    "Excluding Consistency and Set Pieces here is the top attributes for all three positions according to the dataset:\n",
