TODO's

create attribute correlations to other stats not just average rating
for example goals scored, assists, tackles won, headers won etc.

it seems that just adding positions without specifying roles is not particularly helpful the results are pretty weird

Unfortunately this is not possible I need to figure out something else maybe adding an assistant manager would do the trick
In the meanwhile I added the hidden attributes to the view. It will take place in my next exports

Ok assistant helped I can add a new manager once the sim is over. Now I am getting more interesting results

currently goes through all roles assumung edit search is open. This is not good enough I need to open it each time
